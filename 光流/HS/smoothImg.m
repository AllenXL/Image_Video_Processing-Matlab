function smoothedImg=smoothImg(img,segma)
% Convolving an image with a Gaussian kernel.

% The degree of smoothing is determined by the Gaussian's standard
% deviation 'segma'. The Gaussian outputs a 'weighted average' of each
% pixel's neighborhood, with the average weighted more towards the value of
% the central pixels. The larger the standard deviation, the less weight
% towards the central pixels and more weight towards the pixels away, hence
% heavier blurring effect and less details in the output image.
