paper: Representing shape with a spatial pyramid kernel. (Anna Bosch, CIVR '07)



Using the Caltech 101 splits provided on the web and an SVM Classifier you should have the following results:

		Shape 180	Shape180	Shape360	Shape360
		(whole image)	(roi)		(whole image)	(roi)
l=0		13.20		14.70		16.20		17.57
l=1		33.07		38.56		36.14		44.37
l=2		46.99		58.76		47.25		61.69
l=3		48.43		61.04		49.28		61.63

merge 
(exhaustive 
search)		51.76		64.31		54.33		66.27

merge
(varma 
method)		49.21		60.19		50.00		61.04

NOTE: SVM 1-vs-all has been used to learn the level weights when merging all the pyramid levels.

Using the Caltech 256 splits provided on the web and an SVM Classifier you should have the following results:

		Shape 180	Shape180	Shape360	Shape360
		(whole image)	(roi)		(whole image)	(roi)

merge 		
(exhaustive 
search)		16.81		24.28		19.31		27.17



NOTE: again, SVM 1-vs-all has been used to learn the level weights when merging all the pyramid levels.
