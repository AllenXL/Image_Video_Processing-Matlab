% This function performs Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), using the 
% parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Given partial input data, 
% the algorithm computes the expected distribution for the resulting 
% dimensions. By providing temporal values as inputs, it thus outputs a 
% smooth generalized version of the data encoded in GMM, and associated 
% constraints expressed by covariance matrices.
%
% Inputs -----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o Priors:  1 x K array representing the prior probabilities of the K GMM 
%              components.
%   o Mu:      D x K array representing the centers of the K GMM components.
%   o Sigma:   D x D x K array representing the covariance matrices of the 
%              K GMM components.
%   o x:       P x N array representing N datapoints of P dimensions.
%   o in:      1 x P array representing the dimensions to consider as
%              inputs.
%   o out:     1 x Q array representing the dimensions to consider as
%              outputs (D=P+Q).
% Outputs ----------------------------------------------------------------
%   o y:       Q x N array representing the retrieved N datapoints of 
%              Q dimensions, i.e. expected means.
%   o Sigma_y: Q x Q x N array representing the N expected covariance 
%              matrices retrieved.
