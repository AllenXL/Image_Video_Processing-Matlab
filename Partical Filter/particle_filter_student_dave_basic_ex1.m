%Student Dave's particle filter tutorial

%In this tutorial, The Frequentisian Ninja Clan has just run into the mysterious Quail.
%The Quail was just doing it's typical magical quail stuff throughout the forest like, I
%dunno, freeing catapillars from evil monkey spells.
%The ninja clan, knowing the impossible agility of the Quail, began to
%stretch out and prepare for attack.  During which the Quail mediated and
%generated a highly non-linear flight model with strong illusions (i.e. weird measurements :P) and takes off!
%
%The student ninja's make chase but, only knowing linear algorithms, they
%fail very quickly.  However, the Master Frequentisian Ninja knows the
%particle filter, and after a cognitively and physical exhaustive, epic
%chase, the Master catches the Quail, and takes it back to their secret
%Dojo.

%Here, we learn this master skill, known as the particle filter, as applied
%to a highly nonlinear model. :)!
